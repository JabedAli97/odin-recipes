# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to practise newfound HTML skills.
The project will consist of a webpage with links to recipes with a list of ingredients and process.
These recipes will contain picture of the end product too.
This will all be achieved using the knowledge i have obtained from the odin project so far.
